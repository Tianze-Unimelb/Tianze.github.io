Here is **Tianze Zhang (张天泽)**.

I’m a student majoring in CS at the University of Melbourne and also a [Kaggle Competition Expert](https://www.kaggle.com/skygrace). Previously, I served as a research assistant at the Xinjiang Key Laboratory of Signal Detection and Processing, advised by [Prof. Gang Shi](https://it.xju.edu.cn/info/1144/2113.htm), and I still keep in close contact with the lab. I also spent a great summer research project at the University of Hong Kong with [Prof. Heming Cui](https://www.cs.hku.hk/people/academic-staff/heming).
